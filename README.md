spatiotemporal Remote Sensing Analysis – Kubuqi Desert (2015–2024)

#Overview

This project evaluates environmental dynamics in the Kubuqi Desert (Inner Mongolia, China) between 2015 and 2024 using satellite remote sensing and climate reanalysis data.

The objective was to assess vegetation response and thermal behavior in areas containing large-scale photovoltaic infrastructure compared to adjacent desert control zones.

The analysis integrates Sentinel-2 vegetation indices with ERA5-Land climate variables to identify spatial patterns and temporal variation.



#Data Sources

**Satellite Data**
- Sentinel-2 (10m resolution)
- Bands used: NIR (B8), Red (B4), Blue (B2)

**Climate Data**
- ERA5-Land reanalysis
  - Total precipitation
  - Skin temperature



# Methodology

- Vegetation indices: NDVI, EVI, SAVI  
- Annual precipitation accumulation (mm)  
- Temperature conversion (K → °C)  
- Temporal difference analysis (2015 vs 2024)  
- Zonal statistics (Solar infrastructure vs control area)  

All processing performed in a GIS environment using raster-based spatial analysis.



#Key Results

- 48.55% vegetation gain detected between 2015 and 2024  
- Solar infrastructure area exhibited lower mean temperature increase  
- Precipitation growth followed regional climatic variability  
- Results indicate spatial associations rather than direct causality
